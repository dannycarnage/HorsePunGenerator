# HorsePunGenerator
A ruby script that generates horse puns

**What the christ?**

This script horsepunizes an input string by making substitutions from a wordlist file based on how similar the words are. It currently prints all possible horse puns to the terminal.

**Why?**

I need it for a thing

**How do I use it?**

Clone it, grab the dependencies with bundler, then run it like this:

> HorsePunGenerator.rb --sentence "*some text here*"

**Is it production ready?**

Yes, please use it in every production environment you have and report back. No, wait, I mean of course it isn't you idiot unless you work in a horse pun factory and are ready to make the leap into the ***COMPUTER AGE***
